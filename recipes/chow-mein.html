    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>150g/5oz medium egg noodles</li>
        <li>dash toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>300g/11oz skinless chicken breast fillets, sliced into strips</li>
        <li>2 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp five-spice powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp chilli sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp groundnut oil </li>
        <li>1 red pepper, seeds removed and thinly sliced </li>
        <li>150g/5oz bean sprouts</li>
        <li>1 spring onion, sliced lengthways</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the noodles in a pan of boiling water for 2–3 minutes, until al dente, or according to packet instructions. Drain, then rinse under cold running water and drain again. Drizzle with a dash of sesame oil and toss through to prevent the noodles from sticking to each other. </li>
        <li>Put the chicken strips in a bowl and season with a dash of light soy sauce, the five-spice powder and chilli sauce, if using. Mix well, then lightly dust the chicken strips with the cornflour.</li>
        <li>Heat a wok until smoking and add the groundnut oil, then add the chicken and stir fry for 3–4 minutes, or until the chicken is golden-brown and cooked through. </li>
        <li>Add the red pepper and stir fry for 1 minute, then add the bean sprouts and spring onion and stir fry for 30 seconds. Stir in the cooked noodles and season with the soy sauce, a dash of sesame oil and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Pile the noodles onto a serving plate and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
